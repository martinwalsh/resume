  % Hi there, my name is Martin (but you should feel free to call me Marty, most other folks do too). I have enjoyed a relatively long career of 15+ years as a linux system administrator, DevOps practitioner, and open-source enthusiast. I like to think of myself as a code-slinging sysadmin, because I have a strong programming background. I have always found software development interesting, and over the years it's been particularly useful for automatically provisioning infrastructure, deploying code, generating reports, monitoring services for problems before they cause outages,  and much, much more!

  % I am very detail oriented. Folks I've worked with have mentioned that I have a knack for seeing a plan holistically and evaluating the risks quickly. I have a sense of pride being considered a trusted teammate and mentor, with a reputation for high productivity.
  
 %  I am a big fan of ChatOps. Everyone is in chat these days, and it provides a convenient interface for interactive automation where everyone can see (and learn).

  % Hi, my name is Martin (but most folks call me Marty, you should). I like to think of myself as a code-sligning sysadmin. I have enjoyed a career as a linux system administrator, DevOps pratitioner, and open-source enthusiast for a bit longer than 15 years. I am detail oriented and dedicated to delivering on business objectives. I am a trusted teammate and mentor with a reputation for high productivity. I also have a deep understanding of configuration management practices and rationale and therefore I know why they are useful for most businesses, big and small. I am a big fan of ChatOps, feel free to ask me about it if you have a chance. And finally, I have a strong programming background; throughout my carreer I have written code to build infrastructure, deploy code, generate reports and alert the team of issues when they occur, or before.
