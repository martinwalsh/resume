  % Hi there, my name is Martin (but you should feel free to call me Marty, most other folks do too). I've enjoyed a relatively long career of almost 20 years as a linux systems engineer, DevOps practitioner, and open-source enthusiast. I've adopted the moniker of code-slinging sysadmin, because I have a strong programming background; python being my language of choice. I've always found software development interesting, and over the years it's been particularly useful for automatically provisioning infrastructure, deploying code, generating reports, monitoring services, notifying the team prior to outages, and much, much more!

  % I'm very detail oriented. Folks I've worked with have noticed that I have a knack for seeing a plan holistically, and evaluating the risks quickly. I gain a sense of pride being considered a trusted teammate and mentor.

 %  I'm a big fan of ChatOps. Everyone uses chat these days, anyway, and it provides a convenient interface for interactive automation where everyone can see and learn.
