\makelettertitle

With 12 years of experience, I am at ease managing a diverse network of computer systems and associated
services. Although my most recent work experience is decidedly web-centered, I believe that my unique
skillset supports an efficient transition into almost any business context. 

Throughout my career, I have worked in relatively small environments with a high degree of 
responsibility as the sole system administrator; necessitating a great deal of flexability, and 
effective interpersonal, communication and organizational skills. Consequently, I am comfortable working 
with all levels of staff, regardless of technical proficiency, and I quickly build a reputation 
for getting things done. 

I am passionate about solving problems, particularly those well suited to automation. 
I enjoy digging into a difficult technical challenge, recognizing that it often requires learning a 
new skill, concept or technique, and ultimately results in helping someone in a tangible way.
